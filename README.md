# data-structures
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

This repo contains examples we wrote of the common data structures:
  - Linked List & Doubly Linked List
  - Graph
  - Hash Table
  - Set
  - Tree
  - Binary Search Tree
